# 🎵 Music Genre Classification

This project aims to classify music tracks into different genres using machine learning techniques. The classification model is trained on audio features extracted from music data and can predict the genre of a new track based on these features.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `music_genre_classification.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `train.csv` — Training dataset with labeled music tracks and their features.
- `test.csv` — Test dataset for evaluating the model's performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization  

## 🚀 How to Run
